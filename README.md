### Hi there 👋
I'm Wooil Jang (in Korean: 장우일), a real human being! :runner:

I was born and grown up in South Korea. After doing some works in Web and iOS, I unwittingly broke into the world of computer vision and started my adventure. This is a place where I keep my open source projects which you might find helpful. 🌱

The projects I’m currently working on are deep learning based image processing applications such as pose estimation, object detection, etc. I am studying deep learning and trying various experiments. You can find them on my [website](https://woo1.github.io/).
